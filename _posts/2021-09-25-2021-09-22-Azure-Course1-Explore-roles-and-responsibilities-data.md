## 3 Key Roles


* **Database Administrators** manage databases, assigning permissions to users, storing backup copies of data 
and restore data in case of any failures.
* **Data Engineers** are vital in working with data, applying data cleaning routines, identifying business rules,
and turning data into useful information.
* **Data Analysts** explore and analyze data to create visualizations and charts to enable organizations 
to make informed decisions

#### Azure Database Administrator
* The **design, implementation, maintenance, and operational aspects** of on-premises and cloud-based database solutions
* Overall **availability and consistent performance and optimizations** of the database solutions.
* work with stakeholders to implement policies, tools, and processes for **backup and recovery plans** to recover following a natural disaster or human-made error.
* Managing the **security** od data, **granting privileges** over the data, **granting or denying access** to users as appropriate.

##### Tasks and Responsibilties
* **Installing and upgrading** the database server and application tools.
* Allocating **system storage and planning storage** requirements for the database system.
* **Modifying the database structure**, as necessary, from information given by application developers.
* **Enrolling users and maintaining system security**.
* Ensuring **compliance with database vendor license agreement**.
* **Controlling and monitoring user** access to the database.
* **Monitoring and optimizing the performance** of the database.
* Planning for **backup and recovery of database** information.
* Maintaining **archived** data.
* **Backing up and restoring** databases.
* **Contacting database vendor** for technical support.
* Generating **various reports by querying** from database as per need.
* Managing and monitoring **data replication**.

##### Tools
###### Azure Data Studio
* Graphical user interface for managing many different database systems.
* Connection ->SQL Server databases, Azure SQL Database, PostgreSQL, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and SQL Server Big Data Clusters
* Extensible tool -> 1. Download and install extensions from third-party developers that connect to other systems
                     2. Provide wizards that help to automate many administrative tasks.
###### SQL Server Management Studio
* A graphical interface, enabling you to query data, perform general database administration tasks, and generate scripts for automating database maintenance and support operations.
* Generate Transact-SQL scripts -> DBA the ability to schedule and automate many common tasks.
* **Transact-SQL** is a set of programming extensions from Microsoft that adds several features to the Structured Query Language (SQL), 
   including transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables.

###### Azure Portal
* Database services in Azure.
* SQL Server on cloud
* Configuration tasks -> Increasing the database size, creating a new database, and deleting an existing database 


#### Azure Data Engineer
* **Design and implement** data-related assets that include data ingestion pipelines, cleansing and transformation activities, and data stores for analytical workloads.
* **Data platform technologies** - relational and nonrelational databases, file stores, and data streams.
* Ensuring **privacy of data** 
* **Management and monitoring** of data stores and data pipelines to ensure that data loads perform as expected.

##### Tasks and Responsibilties

* Developing, constructing, testing, and maintaining databases and data structures.
* Aligning the data architecture with business requirements.
* Data acquisition.
* Developing processes for creating and retrieving information from data sets.
* Using programming languages and tools to examine the data.
* Identifying ways to improve data reliability, efficiency, and quality.
* Conducting research for industry and business questions.
* Deploying sophisticated analytics programs, machine learning, and statistical methods.
* Preparing data for predictive and prescriptive modeling.
* Using data to discover tasks that can be automated.

##### Tools
* A relational database management system -> SQL
* SQL to create databases, tables, indexes, views, and the other objects required by the database.
* SQL Server Management Studio -> create and query tables visually, but you can also create your own SQL scripts manually.
* **sqlcmd utility** (Command Line) to connect to Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, and run ad-hoc queries and commands.
* SQL server professional -> data manipulation tool might be Transact-SQL.
* Azure Databricks -> a data analytics platform optimized for the Microsoft Azure cloud services platform. Azure Databricks offers three environments for developing data intensive applications: Databricks SQL, Databricks Data Science & Engineering, and Databricks Machine Learning.
* Azure HDInsight to generate and test predictive models. 
  * Azure HDInsight is a cloud distribution of Hadoop components. Azure HDInsight makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. You can use the most popular open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Storm, R, and more. With these frameworks, you can enable a broad range of scenarios such as extract, transform, and load (ETL),
    data warehousing, machine learning, and IoT.
*  The non-relational field -> Azure Cosmos DB. 
*  To manipulate and query the Cosmos DB data -> HiveQL, R, or Python.



#### Data Analyst
* **Maximize the value** of their data assets.
* **Designing and building scalable models, cleaning and transforming data, 
and enabling advanced analytics** capabilities through reports and visualizations.

###### Tasks and Responsibilities
* Making large or complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable.
* Creating charts and graphs, histograms, geographical maps, and other visual models that help to explain the meaning of large volumes of data, and isolate areas of interest.
* Transforming, improving, and integrating data from many sources, depending on the business requirements.
* Combining the data result sets across multiple sources. For example, combining sales data and weather data provides a useful insight into how weather influenced sales of certain products such as ice creams.
* Finding hidden patterns using data.
* Delivering information in a useful and appealing way to users by creating rich graphical dashboards and reports.

###### Common data visualization tools
* Microsoft Office Apps such as **Microsoft Excel** for creating rich visual reports.
* **Microsoft Power BI**, a powerful visualization platform, to create rich, graphical dashboards and reports over data that can vary dynamically.
* Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. 
* Your data might be held somewhere local such as an Excel spreadsheet, or in a collection of cloud-based and on-premises databases, or some other set of data sources. 
* Power BI -> lets you easily connect to your data sources, discover what's important in that data, and share your findings with others in the organization.
