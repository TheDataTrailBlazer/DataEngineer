title: Building with Power BI
---

### Microsoft Power BI 

* A collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.
* Power BI -> connect to data sources, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share.

### The parts of Power BI
* Microsoft Windows desktop application called **Power BI Desktop**, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called **the Power BI service**.
* **Mobile Power BI apps** that are available on any device.
* With native mobile BI apps for Windows, iOS, and Android.

### Flow of work in Power BI

* **Power BI Desktop** -> report is created -> report is then published -> **Power BI service** ->shared using -> **Power BI Mobile apps**

### Building blocks of Power BI
* Basic building blocks in Power BI:
    * Visualizations
    * Datasets
    * Reports
    * Dashboards
    * Tiles

#### Visualizations
* A visual representation of data, like a chart, a color-coded map, or other interesting things you can create to represent your data visually.

#### Datasets
* A collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.
* A combination of many different sources, which you can filter and combine to provide a unique collection of data (a dataset) for use in Power BI.
* The multitude of data **connectors** that are included.

### Reports
* A **report** is a collection of visualizations that appear together on one or more pages.

### Dashboards
* To share a report, or a collection of visualizations, you create a **dashboard**.
* a Power BI dashboard is a collection of visuals from a **single page** that you can share with others.
* A dashboard must fit on a single page, often called a **canvas**.

### Tiles
* A **tile** is a single visualization on a dashboard.
*  _creating_ a dashboard in Power BI -> move or arrange tiles however you want.
*  _viewing, or consuming_ a dashboard or report -> you're not the creator or owner(cannot change but interact only)

### App
* An **app** is a collection of preset, ready-made visuals and reports that are shared with an entire organization.

### Create out-of-box dashboards with cloud services
Click **Get Data** -> **Canvas** ->  connect to **software services** like Salesforce, Facebook, Google Analytics etc -> **Power BI service** provides a collection of ready-made visuals that are pre-arranged on dashboards and reports for your organization called **app**
->Connect to Github -> Dashboard, Report, Dataset(collection of Data) -> Pull Request ->Update the dataset ->Scheduled Refresh ( in Settings)
