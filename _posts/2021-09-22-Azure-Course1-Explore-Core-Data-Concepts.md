## Part 1
* Identify how data is defined and stored
* Identify characteristics of relational and non-relational data
* Describe and differentiate data workloads
* Describe and differentiate batch and streaming data

### What is data?
Data is a collection of facts such as numbers, descriptions, and observations used in decision making. 
#### Classification of data :
* Structured,
* Semi-structured, or
* Unstructured.

### Structured data
1. **Tabular** data that is represented by **rows and columns** in a database.
2. Databases that hold tables in this form are called **relational databases** (the mathematical term relation refers to an organized set of data held as a table). 
**Note**: Each row in a table has the same set of columns.

### Semi-structured data
##### JSON
* It is information that doesn't reside in a relational database but still has some structure to it.
 **Example:** JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

##### Key-Value Pair: 
* A key-value database stores Associative arrays. 
* A key-value database stores data as a single collection without structure or relation.
### Unstructured data
##### Graph Database
* A graph contains nodes (information about objects), and edges (information about the relationships between objects).
